                    Hello! I'm Alvaro Luque, a software engineer from Spain with a passion for technology, 
                    problem-solving, and continuous self-improvement. I love building tools to solve my everyday 
                    challengesâ€”whether it's a small script or a full-scale web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2024 and have been working at Entrust as a 
                    software engineer since my final year of studies. Currently, I'm developing an internal-use chatbot, 
                    where I'm continuously applying and refining my skills in a collaborative environment with high-quality standards.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy reading and taking walks with my dog. These moments help me 
                    unwind and focused to give my best throughout the day and keep on learning new things.
                </p>
